# who_said_it
JSDA Week 4 Project

A quote will be displayed on the screen and user can choose whether they think the quote was said by a Presidential Candidate or Evil Dictator. Once a selection has been made, the name and image of the person who said it will appear. User will be prompted for next quote.

The stats page shows results of the top ten correctly attributed quotes and top ten incorrectly attributed quotes.

The about page shows who worked on this project and links to each member's Github page.
